# ü§ñ AI Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Artificial Intelligence projects developed for study purposes within an MBA program. The goal of these projects is to explore various AI concepts, algorithms, and their potential applications in a business context.

## Projects

Each project resides in its own subdirectory and focuses on a specific AI technique or business problem. Below is a brief overview of the current projects:

* **[`llm/`](llm/notebooks)**: A project dedicated to understanding and experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs). This might involve using pre-trained models for tasks like text generation, summarization, or question answering, and exploring prompt engineering techniques.
* **[`scraping/`](scraping/notebook)**: A project focused on web scraping techniques to collect data from websites to extract relevant information for analysis.

More projects will be added soon üòÅ.

## Purpose

These projects are primarily for educational purposes and experimentation. They serve as practical exercises to solidify the theoretical knowledge gained during the MBA program. The code is intended to be clear and understandable, prioritizing learning over production-level robustness or efficiency.
